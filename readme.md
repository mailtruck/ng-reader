This is a simple app that grabs data from a yahoo pipe via JSONP.

The data is all displayed on a single page with live search/filtering and a checkbox to toggle the article text on and off.

This is my first time using angular and I haven't yet mastered the async flow with [promises](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises).
